### Abstract

The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in an era of unprecedented natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, traditional LLMs suffer from static architectures that require extensive retraining to adapt to new tasks or user preferences, incurring significant computational costs and lacking real-time adaptability. We introduce **Graph-Enhanced Singular Adaptive Learning (GESAL)**, a groundbreaking framework that enables LLMs to learn dynamically from user interactions in real time, storing adaptations in a graph-based structure for scalability and context-awareness. GESAL leverages singular value fine-tuning (SVF) to efficiently modify model weights, a graph of task-specific nodes to retain learned behaviors, and reinforcement learning (RL) to refine responses based on user feedback. This white paper presents the theoretical underpinnings, detailed methodology, implementation specifics, experimental validation, and a comprehensive vision for GESAL’s role in the future of adaptive AI systems. We demonstrate that GESAL outperforms conventional fine-tuning methods in efficiency, flexibility, and responsiveness, paving the way for truly self-organizing, user-centric LLMs.


### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Motivation
Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA, and their successors have transformed natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. However, their static nature—trained on vast, fixed datasets—limits their ability to adapt to individual users or novel contexts without resource-intensive retraining. As AI systems increasingly integrate into daily life, there is a pressing need for models that can learn continuously, adapt in real time, and retain user-specific knowledge efficiently. Graph-Enhanced Singular Adaptive Learning (GESAL) addresses this need by combining singular value decomposition (SVD)-based fine-tuning, graph-based memory, and reinforcement learning, offering a scalable, dynamic solution for self-adaptive LLMs.

#### 1.2 Challenges in Current LLM Adaptation
Traditional adaptation methods like full fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, requiring updates to billions of parameters. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as LoRA and SVF, reduce this burden but remain static post-training, unable to adjust during inference. Moreover, existing methods lack mechanisms to store and reuse adaptations across tasks or users without catastrophic forgetting. Real-time learning introduces additional challenges, including instability in RL updates and the need for efficient memory structures to track evolving knowledge.

#### 1.3 Contributions of GESAL
GESAL introduces several novel contributions:
- **Singular Value Fine-Tuning (SVF)**: An efficient adaptation method that modifies only the singular values of weight matrices, reducing parameter overhead.
- **Graph-Based Storage**: A dynamic graph structure that organizes task-specific adaptations, enabling context-aware retrieval and continual learning.
- **Real-Time RL**: A feedback-driven learning loop that adjusts the model based on user interactions, preventing repetition of mistakes.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Demonstrated compatibility with LLMs like Llama-3.2-1B, with potential for broader applications.

### 2. Related Work

#### 2.1 Self-Adaptive LLMs
Self-adaptive LLMs, such as Transformer² (Sun et al., 2025), aim to adjust behavior dynamically using expert modules or inference-time strategies. These approaches often rely on pre-trained specialists, lacking real-time adaptation from user input.

#### 2.2 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
Methods like LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) and SVF (Sun et al., 2025) fine-tune LLMs with minimal parameters. GESAL builds on SVF, extending it to real-time scenarios with a graph-based memory.

#### 2.3 Graph-Based Learning Systems
Graph neural networks (GNNs) and knowledge graphs have been used for structured knowledge representation (Zhang et al., 2024). GESAL adapts this concept to store LLM adaptations, a novel application in NLP.

#### 2.4 Reinforcement Learning in NLP
RL has enhanced LLMs through techniques like REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) and human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022). GESAL employs RL for real-time updates, ensuring responsiveness to user corrections.

### 3. Theoretical Foundations

#### 3.1 Singular Value Decomposition in Neural Networks
SVD decomposes a weight matrix \( W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \) into \( W = U \Sigma V^T \), where \( U \) and \( V \) are orthogonal, and \( \Sigma \) contains singular values. GESAL modifies \( \Sigma \) via a learnable vector \( z \), yielding \( W' = U (\Sigma \cdot z) V^T \), enabling full-rank adjustments with minimal parameters.

#### 3.2 Graph Structures for Knowledge Representation
A graph \( G = (V, E) \) with nodes \( V \) (task contexts) and edges \( E \) (similarity) provides a scalable memory. Each node stores an embedding and adaptation parameters, updated via cosine similarity-based clustering.

#### 3.3 Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Adaptation
RL optimizes a policy \( \pi \) using a reward signal \( r \). GESAL uses a REINFORCE-like objective, \( J(z) = \mathbb{E}[\log \pi(y|x) r(y)] \), to adjust \( z \) vectors, with a doubled penalty for negative feedback to accelerate correction.

### 4. GESAL Framework

#### 4.1 Overview
GESAL integrates three modules:
- **SVF Module**: Adapts model weights efficiently.
- **Graph Storage**: Manages task-specific adaptations.
- **RL Mechanism**: Updates adaptations based on feedback.

#### 4.2 Singular Value Fine-Tuning (SVF) Module
For each linear layer \( W \), GESAL precomputes \( U, \Sigma, V \) offline. During inference, a vector \( z \) scales \( \Sigma \), applied via efficient matrix operations: \( y = U (\Sigma \cdot z) V^T x \).

#### 4.3 Graph-Based Adaptation Storage
The graph contains nodes with:
- **Embedding**: Average hidden state of assigned inputs.
- **z Vectors**: SVF parameters for each layer.
- **Past Responses**: Prevents repetition of errors.

#### 4.4 Real-Time Learning Mechanism
Given an input:
1. Embed and match to a node via cosine distance.
2. Apply node’s \( z \) vectors.
3. Generate a response, avoiding past errors if feedback is negative.
4. Store interaction in a buffer; update \( z \) when full.

#### 4.5 Integration and Workflow
GESAL operates in a two-phase cycle: inference (response generation) and adaptation (RL update), ensuring continuous improvement.

### 5. Implementation Details

#### 5.1 Model Architecture
GESAL uses Llama-3.2-1B, replacing MLP linear layers with `SVFLinear`. The hidden size is 2048, and the vocabulary size is 128,256.

#### 5.2 Graph Node Design
Each `Node` object includes:
- `embedding`: A 2048-D vector.
- `z_vectors`: List of \( z \) tensors per SVF layer.
- `past_responses`: Set of strings.
- `count`: For embedding updates.

#### 5.3 SVF Linear Layer
```python
class SVFLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, original_linear):
        super().__init__()
        self.original_linear = original_linear
        with torch.no_grad():
            U, Sigma, V = torch.svd(original_linear.weight.float())
            self.U = nn.Parameter(U, requires_grad=False)
            self.Sigma = nn.Parameter(Sigma, requires_grad=False)
            self.V = nn.Parameter(V.t(), requires_grad=False)
        self.z = nn.Parameter(torch.ones_like(self.Sigma), requires_grad=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        Sigma_z = self.Sigma * self.z
        Vx = torch.matmul(self.V, x.T if x.dim() == 2 else x.unsqueeze(-1))
        Sigma_Vx = Sigma_z.unsqueeze(-1) * Vx
        output = torch.matmul(self.U, Sigma_Vx)
        if self.original_linear.bias is not None:
            output = output + self.original_linear.bias.unsqueeze(-1)
        return output.squeeze(-1) if x.dim() == 2 else output
```

#### 5.4 RL Update Algorithm
The update uses a REINFORCE objective, computing log-probabilities over the full sequence (input + response), with padding/truncation for alignment.

#### 5.5 Hyperparameters and Tuning
- `distance_threshold`: 0.5 (node creation).
- `buffer_size`: 5 (update frequency).
- `lr`: 0.002 (RL learning rate).
- `temperature`: 0.7–0.9 (generation diversity).
